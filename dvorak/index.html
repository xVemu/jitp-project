                <p>Dvorak</p>
                <p>is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William
                    Dealey, as a faster
                    and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout (the de facto standard keyboard layout). Dvorak
                    proponents claim
                    that it requires less finger motion and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces
                    repetitive strain
                    injuries, or is simply more comfortable than QWERTY.</p>

                <p>While the letters are in the same places as the regular Dvorak layout, the numbers and most symbols
                    have been moved. The
                    top row contains various brackets and other symbols and the Shift key must be used to type the
                    numbers, like on
                    typewriters. The numbers are arranged with the odds under the left hand and the evens under the

                    Dvorak's original layout.</p>

                <p>Capwell-Dvorak</p>
                <p>I moved ZXCV back to their QWERTY positions so that the shortcut keys associated with them could be
                    used in the QWERTY
                    manner (I also use these frequently with Winamp). Z, I simply switched with the semi-colon key.
                    You'll find out what
                    happened to the other displaced keys (Q, J, and K) later.
                    I switched I and U. I is used about 2.5 times as often as U, so it makes little sense giving that
                    valuable index-finger
                    real estate away to the U key. This reduces finger movement by approximately 8.3%! That is
                    significant! I have no idea
                    why Dvorak didn't do this.
                    I decided to switch A and O. You never type AO, but OA is fairly common, so, on the left side of the
                    keyboard, O should
                    be to the left of A since it's easier to type moving from keys on the outside of the keyboard to
                    keys towards the middle
                    of the keyboard.
                    As I said before, I find it hard to reach the F and X keys the (Y and B keys on QWERTY), so I
                    decided to place the least
                    common keys in these hard-to-reach spots. I placed Q in F's position and J in X's position (I needed
                    to leave Z and X in
                    their QWERTY positions).
                    I didn't like that G was above the H key (because I use the word 'though' a lot), so I moved G into
                    C's old position and
                    replaced G with F (which was displaced by Q).
                    I replaced L with K, the 5th most uncommonly-used key, since reaching for the L key so often in the
                    upper right was
                    hurting my wrist. L then replaced B. B moved to the gap left by V (I wanted B here instead of L
                    because I find this
                    position to be awkward to reach). And that's it!Putting all these modifications together resuled in
                    a finger movement efficiency gain over Dvorak of about 9.7%. Using
                    the same sample text, comparing Dvorak to QWERTY and Capewell-Dvorak to QWERTY, the efficiency gains
                    are 42.5% for
                    Dvorak and 48.4% for Capewell-Dvorak. (Finger distances travelled: QWERTY 1961m; Dvorak 1121m; best
                    evolved layout by
                    Peter M. Klausler 1021m; Capewell-Dvorak: 1012m)</p>
